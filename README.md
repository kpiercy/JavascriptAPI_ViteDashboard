After cloning the repo, To test the api, open two powershell windows in VSCode. In the first, enter "npm run start" enter, this will start the routes server. In the second, enter "npm run startAuth" enter, this will start the authentication server.

Make sure you have all relevant sql stored procedures in their most recent form on your express server and the db and all tables are named properly. Ensure that your user in the Users table is properly setup as well. 

With both servers spun up, you can then use the postman collection to query the api.
